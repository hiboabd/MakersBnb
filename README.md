## Testing

To run Feature and Unit tests run script:  
`./test/tdd.test`

This will run Rspec, with SimpleCov, followed by RuboCop.

To test in browser, run script:  
`./test/web.test`

This will open Chrome in incognito mode and load http://localhost:9292, probably before the server is running, so need to refresh to see page.
